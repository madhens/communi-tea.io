Who doesn't love a tea party? And even if they aren't happening in person just yet, let's have a virtual tea party to celebrate a very geeky occasion - the release of Ubuntu 21.04! Fancy hats are optional, fun is hopefully not! There's so much work and love that goes into these releases, as you can see, and it's a perfect reason to celebrate.

The festivities will start at 9 Pacific/Noon Eastern/16:00 UTC/21:30 IST, and you can join in two ways!

If you just want to watch and chat, [join my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/communiteatime)

If you want to video chat and join the stream, join our [Big Blue Button](https://www.mynaparrot.com/en/join?meeting=65EA1A66-8D9B-458A-A9F8-A1BB2271D581). Enter your name; the password is the adjective of 21.04's code name, lower case.

And if you want to join me in some crafty goodness, here's an [easy origami hippo!](https://origami.me/hippo/)
