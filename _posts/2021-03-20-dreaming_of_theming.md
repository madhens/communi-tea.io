First, a disclaimer. This isn't about me dipping my toes into desktop theming, which despite contributing to an Ubuntu desktop flavor for just over a year and working for Canonical, I still don't know much about at all. (Mental note: read up on theming. Tomorrow. When it's not dark o'clock out there.) Maybe there will be a post about the community aspects of theming to come later, and don't worry, I will herald it with bells and whistles.

This post is all about a proposition: if food helps bring people together, then themed food **super** brings them together.

I blame/credit a presentation I made on Star Trek for an after school thing in high school. I decided to be a good Trekkie and make a themed drink, aka Romulan Ale, which in this case was blue Kool Aid and Sprite. Romulan Synthale, really. But it started a habit of trying to theme food and drink, whenever I could. Having friends over to my dorm room sophomore year for a sleepover beneath a ceiling decorated with glow in the dark star stickers? Clearly an occasion to try and burn the dorm down by roasting marshmallows over a candle to make s'mores. Throwing a Trafalgar Day dinner? Time to make some ship's biscuits to keep local dentists in business and make some lobscouse. Inviting the history honorary over to my tiny attic apartment to watch an episode of *Rome*? Let's make a five course ancient Roman feast, ending with a honey cake that took three times to get right! Getting together with a friend once a week to watch *Bake Off*? Let's make a **themed meal every time**!

You're starting to get the picture.

This past year, there have been no long dinners at a crowded table. No sleepovers, save two very unintentional hospital stays. Making one course meals, day after day after day after repetitive day, is hard enough. Five courses seems like a fairy tale. My *Bake Off* watching friend and I settled for one - **one** - breakfast together, in her driveway, six feet apart, on the day I told her I couldn't take the health risk of being the maid of honor in her wedding.

We all have these stories, these lacunae, these **gaps** that leave a different sort of emptiness in the belly.

But there have been moments, flickers, where themed food helped weave people together, whether friends, families, or strangers. The Star Trek fandom, much like a certain Number One, found their talent at making pizza, and shared pictures of their creations online as we watched the final episodes of *Picard* during the early pandemic. My friend's hybrid wedding shower, which had a Princess Bride themed, also had a signature cocktail/mocktail we called the Dread Pirate Roberts (or the Dread Pirate Westley - a mocktail anyone would surrender to), and as we raised our glasses over the screen, we felt a little more together and a little less alone. Even the Linux conferences I went to had open source themed recipes for attendees to make, either on their own or in online cooking classes. And, in maybe my favorite story, my niece continued her birthday Christmas cookie decorating tradition, unbroken, frosting cookies with friends and family across the country over Zoom.

So as weary as we all are of the endless video calls, I hope even once we're all together, we keep the themed food events, in person AND online. You can bet my office hours for volunteer Ubuntu contributors are going to be called "Communi-Tea Time." Let's have less knick-knack swag, and more custom coffee blends or other drinkable and edible goodies at conferences and in our incentives. Let's embraced themed food, in all it's (occasionally) cheesy glory, and let's definitely embrace having it together, in person and afar.
