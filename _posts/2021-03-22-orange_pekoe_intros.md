My tea set up now a days is a little...fancy. Two of my kettles have temperature settings, and one can be customized to the degree. Most of my tea is loose leaf, and runs the gamut from black to green to red to white to herbals, including this amazing local blend with cacao husks and rose petals. Even though I try to finish a box or bag of tea before I order a new one, sometimes that rule is a little fast and loose. So yes, I am one of **those** tea people.

But how did I get into tea? Bags of Lipton at my Nana's house, brewed without regard for temperature or brew time, and sweetened with more sugar than sense. Coffee was still off limits, but a cup of tea was still something my Nana and I could share, and still do. And for all the fancy tea in my cabinet now, a year into this pandemic I'd so much rather be sharing a cup of slightly underbrewed Lipton, with a dash of sugar, in the San Francisco mug I have claimed as mine whenever I visit, than having a perfectly brewed assam with a dollop of Georgia wildflower honey at my desk, alone.

Company matters, more than we ever realized.  

With my tea analogy now made, how did I get into Ubuntu? My husband got a job in the Atlanta metro area in 2017, and we got a commute - and podcasts.

We had an hour and a half, roughly, to kill in the car four days a week, and my husband, who is the OG Linux geek of this family, suddenly had all these podcasts to listen to. We listened to Linux Action News on Monday (and repeated the intro tune at least once each time), Linux Unplugged on Wednesday, and Ubuntu Podcast on Thursdays. And even though the content of all three shows flew over my head at the start, I liked getting to know the voices coming through our car speakers. And maybe it was my not-so-closet Anglophilia (I'd been to London and the UK four times at that point), but the Ubuntu Podcast became my favorite, and the one I asked for every week. There was just something friendly and unassuming, like a warm bowl of your favorite curry that you keep ordering even though you keep saying "you'll try something new."

And speaking of curry, the end of 2017 came and then the Ubuntu Podcast was off. Off! Until they had a curry lunch in March 2018, and all was right in the world again. (Ask my husband. I was pretty concerned they weren't coming back.) 2018 was a horrific year, for reasons I will dance around, and needless to say, going without a welcome half hour of genial chat about gaming, home improvement, and yes, Linux and Ubuntu specifically, wasn't a fun prospect at the end of that year. So when the show's Twitter account posted a link to their [Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/Plfd07auVLayNLBD) as a way to stay connected, and there was a Google Doodle celebrating [Sake Dean Mahomed](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-sake-dean-mahomed), who opened the first curry house in the UK in 1810, of course I had to join the group and share the link as my introduction.

While making my first post about curry may have helped, I felt welcomed from the start, and encouraged as I started learning the basics of the command line and started dipping my toes into data analytics over the next few months. The regulars on the channel were similar to the podcast hosts in the best ways - warm and witty - and handled my unabashed enthusiasm for what probably seemed like everything. My husband joined shortly after me, and a month or so later, we joined the channel in a race to beat the nation of Iceland in a superpermutation competition, throwing our desktop computers in with everyone else's PCs, ThinkPads, and occasional supercomputer. That Sunday, my husband and I made one of our rare trips out of the house (just practicing for 2020), and went to a meeting of a local Linux group. 

When I shared the story about the superpermutations and this Ubuntu group we'd found online with the group as we sat around a table, it fell flat. The people there were polite enough, but my husband and I felt strangely out of place. On our short drive home, I turned to him and said it was okay if we didn't go back the next weekend, because even if most of the members lived an ocean away, the Ubuntu Podcast Telegram group **was** our Linux User Group.

And so I'd found my bit of the Ubuntu community, and that feeling of welcome mattered. If you're in the Ubuntu community too, I'd love to hear how you found it too. I'm [@communiteatime](https://twitter.com/communiteatime) and can frequently be found in the [Ubuntu Podcast Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/Plfd07auVLayNLBD) talking about tea, food, and TV. Or e-mail madhens@ubuntu.com - no matter how you get in touch, I'd love to hear your origin stories.
