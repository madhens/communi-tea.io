“So, what does a community representative do?”

When I called my mom in late January, in that painfully short/long period between my verbal offer and when I was finally able to [Tweet about the news](https://twitter.com/communiteatime/status/1357332201109671952) once I’d signed my written offer, she had a lot of questions. What was the company? Canonical, spelled out because I know she was going to do an internet search the minute we ended the call. Where would I be working? From home, except when we resumed travel and I’d be flying around the world for events and sprints four weeks out of the year. (My mom, bless her, really wants to go with me to Austin if I ever need to head into that particular US office.) And then the question of what exactly I’d be doing at my desk, in the second bedroom-turned-shared office for me and my husband, and eventually in places like Vienna, Montreal, and South Africa.

I think four (!) months later, I have a better answer than whatever I gave my mom back at the beginning of the year. And because I love having fun with the structure of written things, I’ll break it down by each part of the job title.

# Ubuntu

This part is maybe the most obvious (unless you have a lot of family and friends who aren’t too into all things Linux). But I still think it’s important that Ubuntu is at the heart - and the start - of my job description. Ubuntu is a Linux desktop that began with its first release in 2004 (Warty Warthog) and soon gathered a large and enthusiastic community around it. Canonical began in that same origin story, as a small group of Debian developers hand-picked by Mark Shuttleworth to create a desktop Linux for everyone. 

While it’s been 17 years since that first release, and Ubuntu is, quite literally, everywhere across the globe (and beyond in some cases, but that’s a blog post in itself!), it is still a collaborative effort between paid Canonical employees and volunteer contributors who form the core of the Ubuntu community.

# Community

Defining the Ubuntu Community is both a simple yet complex undertaking. So, let’s think of Ubuntu as….a planet. At the solid center of Planet Ubuntu are the volunteer developers - the [Core Devs](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#CoreDev) and the [MOTUs](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#MOTU) and the flavour developers who keep the whole thing in motion. While some of the core developers have been here since Ubuntu took shape, many others have taken their place in the center thanks to their time, increasing knowledge and skill, and their commitment.
Around this nucleus is the molten outer core of community contributors who might not be developers, but are nonetheless critical to a healthy planet. This liquid group includes translators, documentors, QA testers, bug hunters and fixers, and artists who contribute to both stock Ubuntu and the flavours. It also includes the people who answer the thousands upon thousands of questions asked on forums, AskUbuntu, Reddit, IRC - and it includes the people who ask them! It includes everyone who recommends Ubuntu to their Twitter feed, their friends, or their family. Everyone who uses Ubuntu can become an increasingly active part of this community.

The mantle of Planet Ubuntu are the people who make things on top of Ubuntu. One of the most active parts of the mantle right now is probably our [Snapcraft](https://forum.snapcraft.io/) community, who have created the many snaps that so many of us use to work, connect, and play. This also includes the numerous communities that are part of the Ubuntu extended family, like [Juju](https://discourse.charmhub.io/). It also includes communities connected to ours, such as Raspberry Pi and Flutter. 

Finally, the outermost layer of the community is the people who are making and doing things with Ubuntu. While some of these uses might seem tangential, someone who spins up their first Ubuntu server to host a website or Nextcloud instance could decide to pose a question to AskUbuntu - and as they grew in their knowledge, they could start answering questions! Then they could start writing tutorials, and testing beta images before release. Everyone’s Ubuntu journey starts somewhere, and that’s why our community is as big and broad as it is.

## Representative

There were a lot of words that could have gone into this slot. In the [Ubuntu Discourse post discussing this position](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/future-of-ubuntu-community/17593/28), Mark Shuttleworth said it was “more...community secretary than community advocate, helping to get complicated pieces lined up to empower others to be great.” He also referred to the position as a “community secretary/lead/facilitator/factotum.” I especially like the term facilitator, because one of this position’s key duties is making things happen. When someone in that expansive Ubuntu community described above has an idea, and needs a bit of extra resources or access to make that happen, my job is to connect them to said resources and access on the Canonical side of things. Many of my friends have jokingly called me an idea enabler, and I not-so-jokingly reply that I am a professional idea enabler, thank you very much. This is one of the most rewarding parts of my job - to hear someone’s plan, say “that’s a great idea,” and then help them turn that idea into reality.

The dual meaning of ‘factotum,’ however, is probably the heart of my representing the community to Canonical - and Canonical to the community. Language nerds might know this, but the term comes from the Latin words facere ("to do") and totum ("everything"). While I do have core duties that occur on a cadence - reviewing community fund requests and compiling reports, attending Community Council meetings as a useful guest, organizing and hosting [weekly office hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmliL3NEUSE&list=PL-qBHd6_LXWYQqyrCh2cWT_VZMhw14vyq) as part of the Community Team - a lot of things just pop up. Like our recent move from [freenode to libera.chat](https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2021/05/26/announcing-ubuntus-move-to-libera-chat/). And this move - both massive and quick - was accomplished by a lot of amazing cooperation between the IRC Council, the Community Council, and Canonical and a lot of factotuming on everyone’s parts. Before the move, I had no idea how IRC cloaks or flags worked, and now - well, I have slightly more idea. But this was also a valuable lesson in the other meaning of factotum, albeit a much older one: a servant. Because this position is only a community lead so much as that involves servant leadership - to lead by lifting others up and placing them at the center of everything you do. 



## Ubuntu Community Representative

Fittingly, it was just under a year ago, in mid-June 2020, when I decided to apply for the Ubuntu Community Representative position. I’d started herding Chelsea Cucumber colored cats into getting together and planning for the next release, and I was reading articles by Jono Bacon to prepare for my Google Summer of Code proposal for OpenMRS. The job seemed like a bit of a stretch, but community was becoming increasingly important to my open source involvement. I couldn’t (and still can’t) code, and I botched many a pull request (and still do), but I loved connecting people to projects, resources, and other people to make amazing things happen. At the least, I figured as I sent in my resume and cover letter, I’d get more valuable interview experience. And at best?

Well, I think that’s still to come, but it’s off to one hell of a start.
