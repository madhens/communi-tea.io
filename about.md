Hello! I'm Monica Ayhens-Madon, the supposed brains behind communi-tea.io. If you'd like to know the story behind this punny title, be sure to check out my [introductory post](/introduction/2021/03/02/first_sip.html)!

Currently, I am the Ubuntu Community Representative at Canonical, where I get to help our broader community succeed when it comes to all things Ubuntu. I also contribute to one of our official flavors, Ubuntu MATE, as well as OpenMRS. My hook into open source contributing came via documentation, and that documentation started to circle around community onboarding and engagement. Bringing people together to make amazing things happen was my sweet spot in tech, and I feel extraordinarily thankful to have turned that into the start of what I hope is an equally extraordinary career facilitating communities.

When I'm not working, I enjoy crafting (especially knitting, needlework, and painting), cooking (but not doing the dishes), and playing video games with friends and family. On the Switch, that includes Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, and Worms, and on Steam, it includes Worms, Among Us, and racing games, especially Hotshot Racing with my friends at [Wimpy's World](https://www.twitch.tv/wimpysworld). I've found I'm not halfway bad with cars if I practice, and I am good at murdering people and much less good at covering it up in team meetings. My husband and I live in the Atlanta metro area, and in 'normal' times, some of my favorite things to do here are lurk in our many fantastic tea and coffee shops, explore new neighborhoods on foot and by public transit, stay all day at the Georgia Aquarium, and go to local community-run fandom cons like DragonCon and CONjuration.

I love to connect and chat with people, so feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peripateticacad), [friend me](https://steamcommunity.com/id/madhens/) on Steam, or [follow me on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maddiehens)! Stay tuned for links to book-ish type social media, and if anyone knows a tea or coffee equivalent of Untappd (or wants to help make one) let me know!
